### Avg Speed
The average speed of all the digimon in the dataset is 120.4

### Counting Digimon with a specific attribute
This counts all the digimon with a certain attribute. Takes in the column (the type of value the 
attribute is in) and the attribute name.

### Building a team
I made a function that takes in a maximum memory and minimum attack and assembles a team from the dataset within
the parameters. It outputs an error message if it doesn't find one.

### The Process

The process for finding the avg speed was pretty simple, I just did what was normal for finding an average. Add up
all the values and divide by the number of values.
The process for counting the number of digimon with a specific attribute was similar to the average speed function.
Instead of looking at the speed column and adding up all the values, it looks at the specified column and counts 
the number of digimon with the specified attribute.
For the team maker, I used a brute force method of searching through every possible combination until I found one
that worked. An idea I had but didn't actuallize was organizing the digimon by efficiency (atk/memory) and then 
randomly finding three that were close to the efficiency of the specified values. I bounced this idea off Nick, and 
he and I thought it was a good idea. I never got around to actually coding it though, as I realized that it would be
difficult due to the fact that organizing by efficiency could generate a team that has good efficiency but either too
low or too high attack or memory values to fit.
