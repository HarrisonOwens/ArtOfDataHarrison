The dataset that I worked with is a dataset on Kaggle pertaining to playercounts on steam games. It's a titanic dataset that covers every game on steam from 2012 to 2022,
recording the average, peak, gain, and %gain of players every month. 
[Here's the link](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/josephvm/player-counts-on-steam)

What I wanted to investigate using this dataset was the relationship between the average and peak player counts of popular games, the relationship between gain of players
in popular games, and whether or not a game being new or old affected these.

The relationship that I expected between the average and peak playercounts was a near one to one correlation, as it stands to reason that the peak amount of people
playing a certain game every month should always be somewhere close to the average amount of people playing, unless there is some huge update and the peak players surges
or a mass exodus from the game and the average players drops. This is more or less what I observed, with almost all of the games examined being in the 0.9-1.0 range.
There were a few notable exceptions, such as Football Manager 2022, which had a 0.74 Avg to Peak correlation, and Lost Ark, which had a 0.77 Avg to Peak correlation.

Football Manager 2022 released just 8 months prior to this dataset being collected, having a massive spike of players at the start, shown by it's high peak players, but a
significantly lower average player count, contributing to the overall low correlation. This should be the reason for the low correlation, as the rest of the dataset
seems to mirror each other.

Lost Ark has a similar case, where it also starts with a massive spike of players, but is mirrored by the average player count until May 2022,
where the average player count gets far closer to the peak player count than before.

The idea behind investigating the relationship between gain of players and the difference between average and peak players is that I want to see whether a game's rate of
acceleration in gaining players, it's rising or falling popularity, is related to the difference between average and peak players, or the amount of people who are willing
to sink time into a game. A negative correlation (the gap shrinks as gain grows) between the two should imply that as the game picks up popularity, more people are 
willing to spend more time playing the game, and as the game loses popularity, less people want to waste time playing the game. A positive correlation (the gap grows as
gain grows) would imply that as the game explodes in popularity, there aren't many people who are willing to sink time into it, which should imply that people heard about
the game and tried it out, but didn't like it. It would also imply that as gain falls, the gap shrinks, which could mean somthing like there being a dedicated fanbase that
refuses to give the game up as it falls out of the spotlight. A near-nonexistent correlation would imply that gain increase and gap growth have no effect on each other.

One example of the second case is GTA V, which has a positive gain-gap correlation, which can be seen in how the peak player graph spikes so much higher than the avg player
graph, implying that as the game grows, the gap between people who play the game once to contribute to the peak player count and the players who play regularly gets
larger.

An example of the third case is CS:GO, which has a near-zero correlation for gain and gap, implying that player gain has no effect on how many people try the game once
and never really play regularly.

Counter Strike has been around for a long time, which gives it a very stable community of people who won't leave for other games. This contributes to the non-growth of
the gap between peak and average players per month, which is almost always 400,000 according to the graph.

There is an obvious difference between new and old games, being that new games tend to explode into popularity during the first month and then lose most of the playerbase 
in the proceeding months, while older games retain their playerbase, oftentimes adding more and more players as time goes on. This contributes to the relationships between
average and peak player counts in that new games often have lower correlations, meaning that their explosive releases and chaotic following months give them wildly
fluctuating player counts and oftentimes far higher peak player counts due to their releases being hyped up and advertised. This contributes also to the gain-gap relationship
in that older games oftentimes have a far lower correlation due to already existing, loyal fanbases evening out the player count over time, which new games just don't have.

Some problems with my data collection were that The games I looked at were too specific, or too narrow, and that my methods of analyzing the gain-gap correlation are probably
ineffective. I only included 10 games when analyzing the new and old games, which robbed me of a much broader spectrum of data that would have potentially changed the 
conclusions I reached, especially considering the "old" games I used were massively popular old games. In hindsight, it would have been far more interesting to see
the trends of some less popular, but just as long lasting games. In addition, you might have noticed that I didn't include an example for the first case, being negative 
correlation in gain and gap. This was because all of the data I got with a negative correlation was essentially just new games that fell off really quickly, which I didn't
really think would be helpful to include. This also contributes to my belief that my range should have been wider in this data collection lab, as having more games and
more examples of negative correlation would have been useful.
