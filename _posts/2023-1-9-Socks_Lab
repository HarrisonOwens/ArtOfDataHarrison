Write a blog post that addresses the following prompts. For questions about the dataset, be sure to explain how your code answers the question.

1. Discuss how you used the API to obtain the dataset.
To obtain the dataset, I ran a while loop until the api stopped responding with a 200 status code, and I routed all of the responses into a csv 
file using a dictwriter, which takes a dictionary as input and prints it in the correct format in a csv file.

1. Which sock has the most variations? If there is more than one answer, then list all of them.
There are several socks that have the "most" variations, all of them having 8 different variants.
argyle crew socks,color-blocked socks,frilly knee-high socks,holey tights,kiddie socks,mixed-tweed socks,no-show socks,semi-opaque socks,semi-opaque tights,sequin leggings,simple-accent socks,striped socks,striped tights,tube socks,ultra no-show socks,vivid leggings,vivid socks,vivid tights

1. How many socks of each color are there? If a sock has two different colors, it should be counted in both. However, if a sock has the same Color1 and Color2, make sure you don’t double count it!
Pink: 45, Red: 44, Aqua: 33, Orange: 28, Purple: 39, Green: 51, Blue: 48, Yellow: 34, White: 89, Black: 65, Beige: 16, Gray: 33, Brown: 11, Colorful: 14

1. Discuss your process of how you worked on this lab. Include details such as who you worked with, what methods you tried, what worked or didn’t work, what could have gone better, and what you learned during this lab. Focus more on the programming side of the lab! Feel free to attach images, screenshots, pseudocode, etc to elaborate on your response.
Submit your Python file(s) and a link to your blog post on Google Classroom.
