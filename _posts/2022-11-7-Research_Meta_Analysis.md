Article: [Effect of Addiction to Computer Games on Physical and Mental Health of Female and Male Students of Guidance School in City of Isfahan](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3905489/#S0001title)

1. What are the null and alternative hypotheses? 

Note: The null and alternate hypothesis were never explicitly stated by the article, but they could be inferred from what they’re testing for. 
Null Hypothesis: Video games have no effect on health, physical ability, and social ability.
Alternative Hypothesis: Video games have adverse effects on health, physical ability, and social ability.

2. Who is collecting and analyzing this data? 

Data was collected using a General Health Questionnaire (GHQ-28), which is a self report screening measuer used to detect possible psychological disorder, 
and a questionnaire on addiction to computer games. 
Data is being analyzed by Eshrat Armani (PHD), Maliheh Chashmi (MSc) and Nasim Hedayati (DDS).

3. What datasets does this study reference or use? Are these datasets available to the public?

Dataset used was a sample of 564 students selected through multiple steps of stratified sampling. 
They were all students meant to represent the population of students in the second year of public guidance schools in the city of Isfahan. 

4. Why are they interested in this data? 

This data is interesting to the researchers because computer games were becoming more and more popular, taking up more and more of students’ free time. Authorities and family didn’t have proper plans for using this free time elsewhere, so most of it was spent on video games. This, while providing entertainment in the short term, was said to have led to long term feelings of anxiety and restlessness, and thus, this study was conducted to determine the effects video games have on mental health of students.

5. What data is being recorded? What data might be left out? 

The data that was being measured for from the health survey were physical complaints, anxiety complaints, social dysfunction, and depression symptoms. This was then contrasted with the data from the survey on video game addiction to determine a correlation from the sample.

6. What evidence did they present to back up their conclusions? 

The stated correlation of the negative symptoms to addiction to video games were said to be relevant to a level of P < 0.05, making the study statistically viable. Because the data and survey results aren’t directly provided, there is a remote possibility that they could have p-hacked the results. This could have been accomplished in a variety of ways, one being that they could have purposefully counted or not counted certain questions towards symptoms. It could also be said that only sending out a survey for video game addiction could produce a certain level of bias towards video games being the cause

7. How was this study funded? 

The article doesn’t state where it got its funding, 
but I would assume they got it from some sort of grant from the Kerman University of Medical Sciences or from the Isfahan Board of Education,
from whom they needed permission to collect survey results from the student population.

8. Do you think publish or perish had an effect on this study?

I believe publish or perish could have had an effect on the study because it was from a journal from before regulations were starting to be put into place around such studies. Although it is from a different country, so it might not have had an effect.
