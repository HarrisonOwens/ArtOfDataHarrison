1. What are the null and alternative hypotheses? 

The article doesn’t really say a null or alternative hypothesis, but they could be inferred from what the authors are trying to improve. The null hypothesis would likely be that there is no correlation between addiction to video games and health and social issues. The alternative hypothesis, which is what they’re trying to prove, would likely be that there is a correlation between addiction to video games and health and social issues.

2. Who is collecting and analyzing this data? 

Their data was collected using a General Health Questionnaire (GHQ-28), which is a self report screening measure used to detect possible psychological disorder, and a questionnaire on addiction to computer games. Data is being analyzed by Eshrat Armani (PHD), Maliheh Chashmi (MSc) and Nasim Hedayati (DDS). Because there was no previous data for the reliability of the questionnaire in Iran, a pilot study was collected with 30 students, giving a reliability of 0.76. The trustworthiness of this value could be disputed because the pilot study is so small and there are no details given for the how the data in the pilot study was collected.

3. What datasets does this study reference or use? Are these datasets available to the public?

They randomly selected 3 districts from the 5 in the city of Isfahan, from them selecting one boy and one girl guidance school randomly. From these schools, 600 students were chosen to fill out questionnaires, and after obtaining permission from the board of education, surveys were distributed to these students. 564 students filled them out, 263 girls and 301 boys, creating the dataset they used. These datasets are not available to the public as far as I can tell, and only the conclusions the researchers drew from the dataset are available in the article. 

4. Why are they interested in this data? 

This data is interesting to the researchers because computer games were becoming more and more popular, taking up more and more of students’ free time. Authorities and family didn’t have proper plans for using this free time elsewhere, so most of it was spent on video games. This, while providing entertainment in the short term, was researched to have led to long term feelings of anxiety and restlessness, and thus, this study was conducted to determine the effects video games have on mental health of students.

5. What data is being recorded? What data might be left out? 

The data that was being measured for from the health survey were physical complaints, anxiety complaints, social dysfunction, and depression symptoms. This was then contrasted with the data from the survey on video game addiction to determine a correlation from the sample.

6. What evidence did they present to back up their conclusions? 

Their results stated that 4% variance of addiction to computer games is common with physical disorder, 12% with anxiety and sleep disorder, 1% with social dysfunction, and 6% with depression. The stated correlation of the negative symptoms to addiction to video games were said to be relevant to a level of P < 0.05, making the study statistically viable. Because the data and survey results aren’t directly provided, there is a remote possibility that they could have p-hacked the results. This could have been accomplished in a variety of ways, one being that they could have purposefully counted or not counted certain questions towards symptoms. It could also be said that only sending out a survey for video game addiction could produce a certain level of bias towards video games being the cause

7. How was this study funded? 

The article doesn’t state where it got its funding, but I would assume they got it from some sort of grant from the Kerman University of Medical Sciences or from the Isfahan Board of Education, from whom they needed permission to collect survey results from the student population.

8. Do you think publish or perish had an effect on this study?

I believe publish or perish could have had an effect on the study because it was from a journal from before regulations were starting to be put into place around such studies. Although it is from a different country, so it might not have had an effect.
